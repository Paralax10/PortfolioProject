Here is an explanation about where you can find the structures:

HTML 
1/5 Basic HTML structure: This occurs to every html file I have.
You can check the structure in index.html. 

2/5 HTML structure with clear content differentiation (headings, paragraphs, lists).
This one you can check in aboutMe.html. In row 13 you can see the header, in row 27
a paragraph and in rows 39-44 you'll find the list.

3/5 Use of forms, links, and media:
I added a video. You can see the implementation of the video in 
ATM.html rows 38-51. There is also a link, you can see it in index.html row 44.

4/5 Tables are effectively used. You can find tables in spede.html rows
44-77 and in ATM.html rows 53-86.

5/5 Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, 
ensuring better structure and understanding of the content. You can find an example
of this in index.html rows 19-33 and in spede.html rows 11-19.

CSS

1/5 Basic CSS styling (colors, fonts). You can see examples in styles.css in rows 
89-90. You can also check rows 139-140.

2/5 Use of classes and IDs to style specific elements. You can check that this is
used for example in rows 111-116, 179-188 and 234-251. 

3/5 Implementation of responsive design elements. This one you can find
for example in rows 27-32 and 171-177.

4/5 Use of layouts for advanced user interfaces (arrays, float, flexbox, css grid).
You can see I used a flexbox in rows 27-32 and 171-177.

5/5 Styling demonstrates
a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience. I think
my styling is quite nice for the website. I used tons of pictures and colors and I got
the website to look nice. You can see it in the browser!

JavaScript Basics

1/5 Simple interactions (like alerts on button click). You can check these in
script.js rows 1-19.

2/5 Multiple event listeners and basic DOM manipulations. You can see the ecvent
listeners in rows 22-34. DOM manipulations you can find for example in rows 4-7 and 
50.

3/5 Use of arrays, objects, and functions. You can see used functions in rows 1 and 16.
Arrays are used in rows 22 and 8. There are not any straight objects in the script.js
but I used JavaScript object Date object. You can see it in row 38.

4/5 Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates.
You can find an example of advanced logic in rows 4-6. That is a conditional statement
and it checks what happens with the cursor. You can see the data loop in for example
rows 22-34. It goes through every .project element and adds event listeners for each 
link. The dynamic DOM updates you can check in the clock. This you can find in rows
37-44.

5/5 Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles. I didn't really go by 
Object-Oriented JavaScript principles. I only used the JS Date Object but I didn't 
create any new Objects.


Asynchronous Operations

1/5 Use of timers. I have a timer in the website. When you show no activity for
10seconds, there will be an alert "Aikakatkaisu". You can find the timer in script.js
rows 56-80
